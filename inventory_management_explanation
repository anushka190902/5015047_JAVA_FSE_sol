Exercise 1: Inventory Management System
Scenario:
You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial.
1.	 Understand the Problem:
Handling large inventories efficiently is crucial for businesses to maintain smooth operations, minimize costs, and ensure customer satisfaction. Here are a few reasons why data structures and algorithms are essential in this context:

•	Efficiency: Efficient data structures and algorithms ensure that operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving products can be performed quickly, even as the inventory size grows. This helps in maintaining low latency in operations, which is critical for real-time systems.
•	Scalability: As the inventory grows, the chosen data structures and algorithms should be able to handle the increased load without significant degradation in performance. This scalability is vital for businesses that are expanding.
•	Memory Management: Efficient data structures help in optimal utilization of memory, preventing wastage and ensuring that large inventories do not cause excessive memory consumption, which could lead to slowdowns or crashes.
•	Complex Queries: Advanced data structures can support complex queries and analytics on the inventory data, enabling businesses to gain insights and make informed decisions. For instance, finding the most expensive product, the product with the highest quantity, etc., can be done efficiently with the right data structures.


4. Analysis:

Different data structures can be used to manage large inventories, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here are some suitable data structures:
1.	HashMap:
o	Use Case: When quick access, insertion, and deletion of products are needed.
o	Advantages:
	Average time complexity for add, update, and delete operations is O(1).
	Ideal for lookups using a unique key (e.g., product ID).
o	Disadvantages:
	Does not maintain any order of elements.
	Performance can degrade if there are many hash collisions.
2.	ArrayList:
o	Use Case: When order matters, or sequential access to products is frequent.
o	Advantages:
	Allows indexed access to elements.
	Dynamic resizing.
o	Disadvantages:
	Adding or removing elements (except at the end) has O(n) time complexity.
	Searching for an element by value has O(n) time complexity.
3.	LinkedList:
o	Use Case: When frequent insertions and deletions are required, especially at the beginning or middle of the list.
o	Advantages:
	Efficient insertions and deletions (O(1) if the position is known).
o	Disadvantages:
	Access time is O(n) as it requires traversal from the head.
	Uses more memory due to storing additional pointers.


Choosing the Right Data Structure
The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the inventory management system:
•	For fast access and typical CRUD operations: HashMap is usually the best choice due to its average O(1) time complexity.
•	For maintaining order and performing range queries: TreeMap is suitable as it maintains sorted order and allows for log(n) operations.
•	For concurrent access in a multi-threaded environment: ConcurrentHashMap ensures thread safety with high performance.
•	For scenarios requiring frequent insertions and deletions: LinkedList or ArrayList can be chosen depending on whether insertions/deletions or access times are prioritized.
