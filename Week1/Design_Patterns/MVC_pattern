Exercise 10: Implementing the MVC Pattern

Scenario:

You are developing a simple web application for managing student records using the MVC pattern.

STEPS:
Create a New Java Project: Named MVCPatternExample.
Define Model Class: A class Student with attributes name, id, and grade.
Define View Class: A class StudentView with a method displayStudentDetails().
Define Controller Class: A class StudentController that manages communication between the model and the view.
Test the MVC Implementation: A main class to create a Student, update its details using StudentController, and display them using StudentView.
