Exercise 8: Implementing the Strategy Pattern

Scenario:

You are developing a payment system where different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal) can be selected at runtime. Use the Strategy Pattern to achieve this.

STEOS:

Create a New Java Project: Named StrategyPatternExample.
Define Strategy Interface: An interface PaymentStrategy with a method pay().
Implement Concrete Strategies: Classes CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment that implement PaymentStrategy.
Implement Context Class: A class PaymentContext that holds a reference to PaymentStrategy and a method to execute the strategy.
Test the Strategy Implementation: A test class to demonstrate selecting and using different payment strategies.

By running the StrategyPatternTest class, you should see different payment strategies being used, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the Strategy design pattern.
