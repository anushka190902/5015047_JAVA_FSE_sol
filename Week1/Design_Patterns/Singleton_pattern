STEP 1: Create a New Java Project: Named SingletonPatternExample.
STEP 2:Define a Singleton Class: The Logger class with a private static instance and a private constructor.
STEP 3: Implement the Singleton Pattern: Ensure that Logger follows the Singleton pattern with a public static getInstance method.
STEP 4: Test the Singleton Implementation: A test class that verifies only one instance of Logger is created.
By running the SingletonTest class, you should see that both logger1 and logger2 refer to the same instance, confirming the Singleton pattern is correctly implemented.
