Exercise 11: Implementing Dependency Injection

Scenario:

You are developing a customer management application where the service class depends on a repository class. Use Dependency Injection to manage these dependencies.

STEPS:

Create a New Java Project: Named DependencyInjectionExample.
Define Repository Interface: CustomerRepository with method findCustomerById().
Implement Concrete Repository: CustomerRepositoryImpl that implements CustomerRepository.
Define Service Class: CustomerService that depends on CustomerRepository.
Implement Dependency Injection: Use constructor injection to inject CustomerRepository into CustomerService.
Test the Dependency Injection Implementation: Create a CustomerService with CustomerRepositoryImpl and use it to find a customer.
