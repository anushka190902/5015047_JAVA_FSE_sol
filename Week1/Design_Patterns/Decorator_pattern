Exercise 5: Implementing the Decorator Pattern

Scenario:

You are developing a notification system where notifications can be sent via multiple channels (e.g., Email, SMS). Use the Decorator Pattern to add functionalities dynamically.

STEPS :

1.Create a New Java Project: Named DecoratorPatternExample.
2.Define Component Interface: An interface Notifier with a method send().
3.Implement Concrete Component: A class EmailNotifier that implements Notifier.
4.Implement Decorator Classes: An abstract decorator class NotifierDecorator that implements Notifier and holds a reference to a Notifier object. Concrete decorator classes SMSNotifierDecorator, SlackNotifierDecorator that extend NotifierDecorator.
5.Test the Decorator Implementation: A test class to demonstrate sending notifications via multiple channels using decorators.
By running the DecoratorPatternTest class, you should see notifications being sent via email, SMS, and Slack, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the Decorator design pattern.
