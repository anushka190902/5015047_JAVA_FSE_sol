Exercise 9: Implementing the Command Pattern

Scenario: You are developing a home automation system where commands can be issued to turn devices on or off. Use the Command Pattern to achieve this.

Steps:

Create a New Java Project: Named CommandPatternExample.
Define Command Interface: An interface Command with a method execute().
Implement Concrete Commands: Classes LightOnCommand and LightOffCommand that implement Command.
Implement Invoker Class: A class RemoteControl that holds a reference to a Command and a method to execute the command.
Implement Receiver Class: A class Light with methods to turn on and off.
Test the Command Implementation: A test class to demonstrate issuing commands using the RemoteControl.

By running the CommandPatternTest class, you should see the light being turned on and off, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the Command design pattern.
