Create a New Java Project: Named ProxyPatternExample.
Define Subject Interface: An interface Image with a method display().
Implement Real Subject Class: A class RealImage that implements Image and loads an image from a remote server.
Implement Proxy Class: A class ProxyImage that implements Image and holds a reference to RealImage. Implement lazy initialization and caching in ProxyImage.
Test the Proxy Implementation: A test class to demonstrate the use of ProxyImage to load and display images.
By running the ProxyPatternTest class, you should see that the images are loaded from the disk only once, demonstrating the lazy initialization and caching provided by the Proxy design pattern.
