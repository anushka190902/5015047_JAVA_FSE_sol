Exercise 4: Implementing the Adapter Pattern

Scenario:

You are developing a payment processing system that needs to integrate with multiple third-party payment gateways with different interfaces. Use the Adapter Pattern to achieve this.

STEPS:

1.Create a New Java Project: Named AdapterPatternExample.
2.Define Target Interface: An interface PaymentProcessor with methods like processPayment().
3.Implement Adaptee Classes: Classes for different payment gateways with their own methods.
4.Implement the Adapter Class: Adapter classes for each payment gateway that implements PaymentProcessor and translates the calls to the gateway-specific methods.
5.Test the Adapter Implementation: A test class to demonstrate the use of different payment gateways through the adapter.
By running the AdapterPatternTest class, you should see different payment gateways being used through the PaymentProcessor interface, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the Adapter design pattern
